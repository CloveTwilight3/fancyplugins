## :icon-repo-forked: Paper Hardfork

You can read about the reasons and changes in this article on the PaperMC forum: [The future of Paper - Hard fork](https://forums.papermc.io/threads/the-future-of-paper-hard-fork.1451/).
It basically allows the Paper team to work on adding support for new versions after without having to wait on Spigot to update. This means that Paper is able to also update to snapshots, pre-releases and release candidates.

This is perfect for us, because we can as well update our plugins faster to new versions and snapshots faster. Once the Paper team has updated to a new version (realase or snapshot), we can immediately start working on updating our plugins.


## Conclusion

We are excited about the new changes and the Paper hardfork. We are looking forward to updating our plugins to the new version and snapshots faster than before.
